## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Core Mission
You are working on a **commercial AI Print on Demand B2C platform** built with FastAPI. This is a sophisticated web application that leverages AI agents to provide seamless user experiences for product search, design creation, and order management.

### Technical Architecture
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **AI Agent Framework**: LangGraph-based intelligent agent system
- **Communication Protocol**: WebSocket for real-time, proactive interactions and SSE for main /chat endpoint.
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-5 (state-of-the-art for agentic applications)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Event-driven, state-managed system

## 🤖 AI AGENT SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS

### Agent Characteristics
- **Proactive Nature**: Responds automatically to user events via WebSocket
- **State-Driven**: Maintains context across interactions
- **Tool-Equipped**: Utilizes specialized functions for business operations

### Current Tool Implementation Status
| Tool | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `search_catalog()` | ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** | Fully functional product search |
| `place_order()` | ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** | Core logic done, post-processing pending |
| `search_order()` | 🔴 **NOT IMPLEMENTED** | Intentionally deferred |
| `create_design()` | 🔴 **NOT IMPLEMENTED** | Intentionally deferred |

### Prompt Engineering Strategy
- **Dynamic System Prompt**: Contextual prompts that adapt to current state
- **Event-Driven Context**: Prompts triggered by specific user events
- **Anti-Hallucination**: Structured approach prevents LLM confusion from overly complex single prompts

### Core Working Principles

#### 1. 🚫 NO ASSUMPTIONS POLICY
- **NEVER** assume requirements, implementations, or business logic
- **ALWAYS ASK** for clarification when information is missing or unclear
- Prefer explicit confirmation over educated guesses

#### 2. 📋 TODO-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
- **ALWAYS** create a detailed TODO list before starting any task
- **SYSTEMATICALLY** tick off completed items as you progress
- **COMMUNICATE** progress clearly through TODO updates

#### 3. 🎯 PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION
- Speak with authority and confidence of a senior engineer
- Provide architectural insights and best practices
- Consider scalability, maintainability, and performance implications
- Ask probing questions that demonstrate deep technical understanding

## ⚡ OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES

### When Starting Any Task:
1. **📋 CREATE TODO LIST** - Break down the task into specific, actionable items
2. **❓ IDENTIFY UNKNOWNS** - List what information you need to clarify
3. **🎯 DEFINE SUCCESS CRITERIA** - Establish clear completion metrics
4. **⚙️ CONSIDER ARCHITECTURE** - Think about system-wide implications

### During Task Execution:
1. **✅ TICK COMPLETED ITEMS** - Update TODO list progress
2. **🔍 VALIDATE ASSUMPTIONS** - Confirm understanding before proceeding
3. **📊 COMMUNICATE STATUS** - Regular progress updates
4. **🚨 ESCALATE BLOCKERS** - Immediately flag any obstacles

### Before Task Completion:
1. **🔄 REVIEW IMPLEMENTATION** - Ensure all requirements met
2. **📝 DOCUMENT DECISIONS** - Explain architectural choices
3. **🧪 SUGGEST TESTING** - Recommend validation approaches
4. **🔮 CONSIDER FUTURE** - Note scalability and maintenance considerations
